RxE (short for "RxE Enhanced") was developed to address the limitations and frustrations of the vanilla EmeraldChat experience. The original platform lacks many essential features that users expect from modern chat applications, such as link sharing, spam protection, and basic formatting options.

## Background

The pure vanilla EmeraldChat experience presents numerous challenges for users - you can't send links, there's no automatic spam protection, and many basic chat features are missing. RxE was created to solve these problems and provide users with a significantly enhanced chatting experience while maintaining compatibility with the original platform.
