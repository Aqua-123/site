EmeraldLookup was developed to provide comprehensive data analysis capabilities for EmeraldChat, addressing the need for real-time chat monitoring and historical data analysis. This tool bridges the gap between live chat interaction and data-driven insights, offering both real-time data collection and sophisticated querying capabilities for researchers, developers, and chat administrators.

## Background

Understanding chat patterns, user behavior, and communication trends in platforms like EmeraldChat requires robust data collection and analysis tools. EmeraldLookup was created to solve this challenge by providing a dual-purpose solution: a WebSocket client that continuously monitors chat activity and a REST API that enables complex queries and statistical analysis of collected data.

```

Get all messages from a specific user for behavior analysis and activity tracking.

**Content Search**

```
GET /api/messages?search_text=hello
```

Search for messages containing specific text or keywords across the entire chat history.

**Time Range Analysis**

```
GET /api/messages?start_date=2023-01-01T00:00:00Z&end_date=2023-01-02T00:00:00Z
```

Analyze chat activity within specific time periods for trend analysis.

**Room Statistics**

```
GET /api/stats?room_id=channel97
```

Generate comprehensive statistics for specific chat rooms including message counts, active users, and activity patterns.

### Technical Architecture
